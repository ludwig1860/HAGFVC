# HAGFVC
A half-Gaussian fitting method to estimate green cover of vegetated area from UAV RGB images

Half-Gaussian fitting for fractional vegetation cover (HAGFVC) estimation has ability to accurately estimate green cover from UAV or other low-altitude remote sensing RGB images. The advantage of HAGFVC method is that it can minimize the negative effect of mixed pixel in image classification and characterize scale-invariant to some extent.
